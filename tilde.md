# About those wiggly lines

*Coming Soon* -- Idea in progress. Ignore for now.

* Format ~s etc

* ~<cr> ignore eol. c.f. bash \ line continuation

* ~: ignore whitespace

Probably should expand this as per http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/X_Mast_9.htm for thigs like this:

```lisp
   (1- 5/3)
```

which results in 2/3. And *that* is quite mysterious to me atm... 1+ results in 8/3, btw.
